           <h1>About us</h1> <p>
            Serving since 1983  <br> <br>
            The elite restaurant Restaurant was established in 1983 as an ala-carte eating place to meet with the increasing demand for specialized food and catering services in Nigeria.<br>
            <br>In 1996, the elite restaurant became a Limited Liability Company (RC287, 229) and in the year 2006 metamorphosed into a quick service restaurant to meet the growing demand for a fast food type of service.<br><br>
            the elite restaurant operates under the ambit of existing laws and strives to continually improve on best practices synonymous with the industry.<br> <br>It is a high growth venture which has outgrown the initial business status, having birthed two new companies, namely Jayden Food and confectionery and Premier Chef, <br><br>with the latter taking care of the emerging trend of Corporate and Social Events. <br>        
      <br>      These businesses are managed, by a team of trained professionals with specific competence in the food business/industry.
